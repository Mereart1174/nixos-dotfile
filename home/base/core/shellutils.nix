 # zoxide is a smarter cd command, inspired by z and autojump.
  # It remembers which directories you use most frequently,
  # so you can "jump" to them in just a few keystrokes.
  # zoxide works on all major shells.

  #   z foo              # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo
  #   z foo bar          # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo and bar
  #   z foo /            # cd into a subdirectory starting with foo
  #
  #   z ~/foo            # z also works like a regular cd command
  #   z foo/             # cd into relative path
  #   z ..               # cd one level up
  #   z -                # cd into previous directory

  #   z foo<SPACE><TAB>  # show interactive completions (zoxide v0.8.0+, bash 4.4+/fish/zsh only)
